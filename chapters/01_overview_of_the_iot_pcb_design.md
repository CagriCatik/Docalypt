# Overview of the IoT PCB Design



I'll guide you through the design of a custom PCP using KiCad 9. I'll start by showing you what the final PCB of this work is going to look like. I am using the 3D viewer here in kick up 9 to show you I've already exported and sent this PCB out to next PCB uh the manufacturer that I've selected for this project who is also the sponsor of this video and I thank them for that so I'm expecting to get this manufactured PCB from next PCB very soon so I can just do some Hands-On testing but until that happens I can show you what the 3D representation of this PCB looks like and just have a look at the various components that are on the PCB so let's say that this is a medium complexity PCB it's four layers in it it's got a bunch of integrated circuits on it it's powered by an ESP 32 uh C3 S2 as you can see up here the location of the components matters of course the location of things such as capacitors and connectors and so on is also important this is one of the things that I'll be going through in this video so this is what the PCB looks like eventually as you can see it's packed with a bunch of great features it's an iot development board designed from scratch and I'm going to show you you how to design this from the very beginning which has to do for example with selecting appropriate components here's the bill of materials for the components a number of components here that are I guess non-trivial to include into a PCB like this we need to go through data sheets and figure out how to do the connections what kind of circuitry is required to provide Power grounding um this Thal concerns to look into as well signal Integrity all those very interesting bits and pieces that are required to consider when you're designing a non-trivial PCB so we're going to do all that we're going to continue then with the schematic design going to go into a little bit more detail about what's happening here in the next segment of this video so there schematic design and then there is the layout here now one thing that I should point out is that designing a board like  this in real time takes time so I designed like this and assuming that I know what I'm doing but I don't have full knowledge of all the components that I'm working with some of those components I might be working for the first time ever meaning that I would have to do a bit of research about them read the data sheet understand how they work and then make them work with the rest of the components I'd say would take about 1 to two days for an experienced engineer of course don't worry because in this video I have com pressed the entire process to make it fastpaced and engaging for you without skipping though any of the important steps that matter for learning how to design a medium complexity PCB like this one another thing to point out is that I am recording this video in kiab 9 rc1 so that's release candidate one that became available in early January 2025 I'm expecting to see Ki out Version 9 the version published sometime in late February to early March but I don't expect any significant or even small changes really between the uh final

version of kick at 9 the release version and the release candidate that I'm using for this recording so you don't have to worry about any differences or changes between what you see in this video and what you will be seeing in kickout 9 okay so having said that let's have a look at at what this board contains just to get an idea of the complexity that's involved so I'll start from the right side and then move to the left so on the right side you see here the esp32 C3 S2 system on a chip just below it I've got

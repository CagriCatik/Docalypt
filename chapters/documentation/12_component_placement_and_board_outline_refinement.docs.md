# PCB Design Overview

## Component Placement Strategy

The active circuitry is positioned centrally on the board to minimise trace lengths and to keep the most critical signals short and well‑shielded. Passive elements such as decoupling capacitors are placed immediately adjacent to the active devices they serve, which reduces the loop

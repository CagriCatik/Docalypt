# Design for Manufacturing (DFM) Checks



to save next up I'm going to do design for manufacturing checks these are the checks that help make sure that the board is fit for manufacturing and there's no issues in it that may delay or maybe even make impossible manufacturing PCB design itself is fine as far as the electrical design rules checks are concern concerned however that doesn't mean that it can be manufactured that's where the dfm check comes in for the dfm check I'm going to use a free tool that is available from next PCB that you can use it both online

or as a Windows application next BCB has a version of the dfm Checker as a plug-in that I've installed and you can see it right here but the problem is that this plugin doesn't seem to be working properly with the release candidate 2 version of kick at 9 it doesn't actually work so I'm not going to bother with it at all I'm just going to do all of the dfm checks using the Windows application the thing to remember is that the Windows application is more capable compared to the kiat plug-in but the nice thing about the Ki

plugin once it's back online for KI at 9 once Ki 9 is actually released and the plug-in works is that it's embedded in the kiat environment and you'll be able to do any required changes on the fly without having to go back and forth between the windows dfm tool and kiad before I get started just also wanted to show you that you can download your copy of the HQ dfm tool from this page here on the next PCB website to make this work before I go to my Windows Virtual Machine where I have installed the analysis tool you need to export the

Gerber files from kiad there's the plotter button that allows you to export Gerber files or you can do this via file fabrication outputs and G files so I'm going to create a output directory I'm just going to call it ESP 32 project gers the layers included are fine as they are here I'm only going to set Proto file name extensions and click on the blue plot file and refill here the other thing is to generate the drill files for any holes of years click generate again and close and here is the project directory and

you can see my Gerber files right here so next up let's go to Windows I am going to copy the directory across so that I can import it into the analysis tool here it is and there's the gab files so start the analysis tool and I'm going to drop all of these files in the layers Tab and that does the analysis very quickly all done it's quite an interesting piece of software actually if you want to spend a bit of time exploring it I do have a Blog on the tech Expressions website that talks about this in a little bit more detail

that includes a video shows you things about the reports that can come out of this but let's go straight in it to see what it does there's a 3D view as well which actually is quite nice nice work all right so here you can see the results anything that's green obviously nothing to worry about uh anything that is orange maybe have a look a closer look at it but definitely things that are red you need to check for example let's go for the anular ring size click on the red button to check it and the tool will pan exactly where the

problem is now this is focusing on the esp32 ground pads and pins and there's nothing that we can do about this because this is just what the esp32 ground pins are like so there's nothing I can fix here so what the tool is saying here is that in this particular instance there is a V with an anular ring that is 1 95 Ms in size and it's telling me that it should be over 5 Ms if I look at the actual one which is this one right here clicking on it text me to these properties and the diameter is 0.5 Ms the hole is 0.3 mm the

difference is 0.2 so 0.2 two is actually sufficient because the 5 Ms which is a thousandth of an inch is equal to 0.127 mm which means that this anular ring is actually bigger than the minimum based on that I'm not going to do anything about this I'm just going to leave it as it is and moving on to the pth anal Rings again here there's one that is belonging to the USB port it's this one here and again this is design geometry of the USB port and I'm not going to do anything about it next is the Dual to Copper these are actually

all things I can fix quite easily so there's these and there's a so to trace and N pth so let's do these first so I've got the V to trace outer you can see this uh right here this V is to close to this track here so I'm just going to move it down a bit just like that and that will take care of that issue next one is this one here with this V right there so I'm simply going to move it a little bit to the left and that will sort it out okay next one this one is this so this is easy to fix again just add a bit of

space like this away from the V that's done and one more think yeah this one here right here so move that out a bit towards the left and that will sort it done moving on N PD H I think this is fine so I'm going to leave this alone drill to Copper done moving on copper to board Edge so this is the the edges a bit too close to the board so the copper fills are apparently too close to the edge in the inner copper layers so this may be able to fix quite quickly by looking at the zone select all of those and change the

clearance according to the tool the clearance common 0.2 mm so let's put a 0.2 mm here okay 0.2 mm and refill everything okay now that Gap is bigger okay let's continue next one up is the drill spacing and okay these are again issues that have to do with the geometry of the USB connector there's nothing really that I can do about but I've checked with next PCB and this is not a problem for them to manufacture this is it with the dfm check next up in my to-do list is to continue working on the silk screen so the silk screen will contain text and

some graphics to improve the usability of the board by providing information to the user for things such as what each one of these pins are or what kind of component is this to help with assembly information about the version of the board perhaps website URL for information on software and example applications and so on so anything that is useful can go on the silk screen I'm going to be working predominantly on the top S screen but remember that there's a lot of space on the bottom side of the S screen that you can put more text or

Graphics by the end of this process I'm going to have something like this an example of what the end result of my silk screen work will look like you can see in this case I actually removed couple of mounting holes to make space for the text and for the graphics in essence what I did was to add explanatory text like up here for the ru of each of the pins I used lines to create borders around components that belong together so for example all of those components belong to the sound sensor I've got some information about

the role of the LEDs here what each one of those LEDs does so that you know what it is when you look at it and that's pretty much it that's a couple of logos here as well I'm going to go ahead and do that work now I've decided to remove those mounting points because I think that the silk screen is more important than those mounting points so let's go to the front silk screen I'm going to remove this and this mounting holse because I need this space to provide some information about the LEDs another thing that I'm going to do before I fast

forward this part of the video is that I'm going to select these text items and hide them because I'm going to replace them with new text items that describe the use of the LEDs so these are I'm going to make them disappear so these are not visible anymore going to do the same thing with there's two more LEDs so there's also this and this led text items to make invisible I'm also going to remove the ref that's not going to be visible either no need for that to be visible and that's pretty much it so the first thing is I'm going to start with

the borders I like especially because this is a practice board like an educ ational board I like the idea of creating borders around the functional components that belong together and Implement a particular function on the board so anyone who is learning about PCB design and using this board as an example will able to look at it and know immediately what the various subcircuits on this board do I will pick the line tool and create a border around the components that belong together I'm going to go for Z point 1 mm just to

make it easier to draw okay start here up to here and up and close that box take text box and put that and name this box charger I'll place it in here I can actually give it a 45° angle actually should be minus 45° you can play around with the angle to make it fit nicely with the line next I'll create labels for those LEDs here so the first one is for charging power to indicate that charging power is okay the other one here is that the battery is charged and the third one is that the battery is charging that's why I made

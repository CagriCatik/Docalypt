# Researching and Sourcing Components

manufactured so I should have it maybe in one or two weeks we'll see how that goes and I'll report on that later in this video with all that in mind you already know that the PCB that uh I'm designing in this video is built around the esp32 and I selected this MCU due to its high processing power and integrated wireless communication it's got a dual core architecture and this ensures lots of available data processing power making it suitable for handling multiple sensor inputs and Performing realtime data analysis and I I also want to use

this board once it's ready and manufactured to play around with esp32 artificial intelligence capabilities of course being familiar with his MCU is an added bonus this is hardware that I am familiar with I also wanted this board to be a fully fidget iot board Internet of Things board which would be a good PCB design example for this video so I've added a bunch of sensors as you already know there is the BME 280 there's a microphone sensor and there is a light sensor as well and these sensors are supported by their own dedicated

support circuitry the board also has power management so I've designed the board to support two power sources one is directly through the usb3 port and another one is through a battery that can connect via this connector here and they both have their own supporting circuitry then since this is an iot board I wanted to offer a couple of different ways for recording data the first one is through the SD card right here so the SD card RM module is uh used for local data storage and it allows a system to log large amounts of data

independently without the need for the esp32 to be connected to the cloud and this is particularly useful in remote or offline scenarios so when you want to use the data stored on the SD card simply remove it from the module and copy the files on the computer and to complement the SD card module this board also includes a flash memory integral circuit right here it's onboard flash memory chip which provides fast nonvolatile storage for data and firmware and that ensures that any important data remains intact even after

a power cycle the flash memory can store things such as configuration files and sensor calibration data and even firmware updates where the SD card can store data from the sensors that you may want to be able to quickly copy across to a computer uh so that the two are complementary of each other the other thing to mention here has to do with the dimensions and the layout of the PCB so designed the layout to keep the board compact while ensuring that any recommendations from the component manufacturers are adhere to so the most

important component on the board is the esp32 Chip And that's mostly because of the integrated antenna and essentially I started the design of the project as you'll see later when we get to the layout part of the video around this component especially if have a look at the documentation for the data sheet you see that what I'm looking at here is the data sheet for the esp32 from Express if systems you can see that the data sheet offers a few positioning ideas or locations that are approved and correct by the manufacturer so I studied this

document and I concluded that probably the best way to put the as32 on the board would be to combine something like this so position number three in this positioning example with something like this so I ended up with a design that combines the two I didn't like the idea of having the antenna poking out too much because I didn't want it to be damaged I envisioned this PCB eventually going inside a project box I didn't want this antenna to be out too far but I also needed to make sure that any components around that would not

interfere with the radio capabilities of the board so I looked at the documentation and came up with this positioning again I'm going to talk more about this later on in this video when we start working on the layout aside from the esp32 my positioning uh choices had to do with the user interface requirements so you can see for example the buttons here the connectors tend to be around the edges of the board and another consideration would be to keep components that are part of the same group together so you can see the

components that have to do with the enable and the boot Button are together close in proximity the components that are used to implement the flash memory and it supporting bits and pieces are all together and so on again we'll talk more about all these later in this video as much as possible I tried to collect all the bits and pieces that I need for the project ahead of time so that my actual design work is as smooth as possible what that means is that I do quite a bit of research and spend a bit of time on this to find the components

that I need and then collect all these components both the sources of the actual physical components that will end up on the board plus information such as data sheets and the library that I will need to import into kard having said that there's always times where I make a decision of a particular component that ends up being the wrong decision and then I have to just fix the problem on the Fly that happened in a couple of times with the USB connector uh I'm made choices about the USB connector a couple of times prior to settling to this

particular connector that after going through with a design pretty much completing the board I realized that the original decisions were incorrect for whatever reason usually it has to do with things such as the availability of the components of being out of stock or some other technical issue like for example making it fit on the board alongside the other components so these are a few things to keep in mind so what I want to show you here in this segment are some of the sources that I used to do my research to find the components

that are needed so again I started with the main comp component the esp32 and then I worked my way down to other components such as integrated circuits connectors USB plugs buttons the SD card module and things of that sort and I used online resources such as snap magic and snap.

com most of the components that I found come from snap magic and I also used snap magic to collect the majority of the footprints symbols and 3D models I'm going to show you more about this in a moment aside from snap magic there's also lots of other places and just as an indication just for your information I'll just mention component search engine right here I used that for a few of the components there is uh ket.

com dig key bu views usb. RG I use this site to better understand how the USB module Works uh there's on semi for some of the components spark fun Texas Instruments silicon labs std.com and a few more as I'm going through this research I always make sure that I record everything in Kad itself because I see kiad as the center of my project so in kads schematic editor you can go to simple Fields table and you can see here that each one of the components have made some notes so for example I'm just going to move over

so you can see here for example I've just enabled comments so you can see that I've made a note of the source of the particular component here so this would be the LED so you can see I click on it in the fields table the item in the schematic diagram appears so here's a fuse for example you can see that I got this fuse from this particular location so I can always go back and I can also share this information with manufacturer so that they have my notes it just improves Communications so that's one example going ahead ahead of time of course

because obviously I have completed this project but most of the work that you see here in the files that I have included in the project directory I've done all that as well before I actually started the design process so I didn't have all of these symbols but I had most of the symbols collected ahead of time um as I went through the project I realized that I've made a few mistakes or a few things were missing so I went back to resources such as snapa to fill in the missing bits and pieces another thing that I also collected in parall

are the data sheets much of the work that goes into designing a PCB has to do with reading data sheets because the manufacturers provides information on how to do the wiring for this particular component so as long as you understand what you're seeing here you you can literally copy the recommendation from the manufacturer into the design so the design that you see here in the data sheet is basically what I have followed I'm just going to show you really quickly let's go to the root is what I followed right here so the component

that you see here the laaa integrated circuit which is U1 is this component here and I simply followed the recommendation from the manufacturer so spend a bit of time both collecting the data sheets for the components that you'll be using and also looking at them and reading them and understanding how to do the wiring as per the recommendations of the manufacturer again most of the work for doing that I did in uh snapa so if I go back to snapa I'm just going to show you really quickly let's say that I'm looking for

one of those components this is the bomb EXO shade that I'll be sharing as well let's have a look so here's one see Napa this is the USB receptable so I'm just going to search for this connector just going to go for the package actually search for this in snapa and here it is Click through and here snap magic gives you both a data sheet PDF which I always save that in the project directory so that everything is together so I store that file on my computer and keep it in the project directory I do the exact same thing then

for the symbol in the footprint so I go go for kick at 6 or later so allow the download so here are the three files that uh I just downloaded and I've already stored them so here's a 3D model here is the footprint and here is the symbol I'm going to show you later how to import these symbols into kiad uh so that we can use them for now I'm just storing them into my project directory so I do all that and once I'm confident that I've got prettyy much everything that I need or at least most of what I need I begin with the project what I've

got here is kick at 9 I've got the release candidate version I just up updated this morning the latest available version and I'm just going to show you where I got it from I'm running my Coos so this is the location where I downloaded this particular file here and then installed it and on my computer I'm just going to show you one more thing I'm running two versions of Kad this one is Kad 8 which is the official version stable version that it's available at the time I'm recording this video and of course in parallel I'm running kickout 9

# 3D Model Configuration and Visualization

for a PCB only without any components assembled on it and the other one is to go for the full assembly if you go for the quote all you've got to do is to upload the Gerber files if you go for a a assembly though things are a little bit more involved because you've got to upload the G files plus there's a bunch of files for the assembly part of it I'm going to go through the PB assembly quote process very quickly with you now first thing to do of course is to start with the Gerber files and since I've made a few changes to the PCB since last

time I exported my gers so I'm going to go and do that again so click on the plot file everything is already selected just going to use the same output folder and the new files here that I'm about to generate will overwrite the old files and that's okay so click on plot so yep refill the zones that's done with the layers and then the drill files same thing generate and that's done then let's go to the project directory and uh here is the Gerber files and I'm going to create a zip file from the G because that's how next PCB and actually in this

case most manufacturers want the G files to be bundled inside a zip file now let's head over to the website so here I just need to drop the Gerber files see if I can do a drag and drop that you work yes it did I'm using Safari here and I've also done this with Firefox and chrome it all works the back end next p be the website will analyze the files and giv me a view I can have a look at the view or I can also go to the G viewer the online tool that they have here analyzing the files I didn't have to re-upload them it's very convenient

and then it gives you one more chance to have a look around and make sure that nothing has been missed have a look at the layers this is what next PCB is going to work on they remember they don't have access to KY card they only have access to the gber files that You' just sent them I've already done a lot of checking so I'm not going to do anymore going to go back to the first step of the process here select the various parameters next PCB already detected that I've got four layers which is correct it's detected the dimensions

I can choose here how many copies of the PCB I'd like to have any other parameters color PCB thickness I just go with the standard whatever is standard here I go with that anything else you check here will have an increase in price and let's say that you're happy with this next step is step two which is the assembly so now two additional files are needed the first one is the croid file the croid file is a data file used in electronics manufacturing to provide precise information about the placement of components on our PCB it's also known

as a pick and place file or XY data file you need to first export it from kard before you can upload it to next PCB so let me show you how to do that you got to file in the PCB editor then fabrication outputs look for component placement POS or gbr file click on that I'm just going to leave the output directory as this this is the home of the project directory and nothing else is needed just generate the position file that's it 81 components information so I can close this and then have a look at the new file that was just generated

let's see it's this one right here one for the bottom and one for the top the one for the bottom doesn't have any information in it because there's no components on the bottom side but the top side has components so this data in here it looks like this so the components it's reference it's value the package and the exact position whether it's rotated or not you can see it's all top side so I'm going to take this file and upload it to next PCB it says that I need to zip this file up even though it's a single file I'm

going to do so just compressing it into zip and upload it it's done so how many copies would I like let's say five then they need the bomb file the build of materials file here is my build of materials there's a lot of information in here but it's actually not that difficult and time consuming to put this file together you can get all the information that you need from E schema so in E schema click on this button here to bring up the symbol Fields table and from here you can select all the columns that you want to export in the bomb if

you look at the next PCB instructions they need a number for the row designator quantity manufacturer part number procurement type and customer note and you can download a template as well so make sure that all of these columns exist in your table and you can enable or disable these columns by clicking on these boxes then go to the export Tab and you can export it from here so I've already done this and this is the bomb file that I've already actually sent them it's got the information that they need plus more

information especially the description is very important because I can include things such as the source of a particular part you can see here I've got snaper where I sourced and verified that this particular component is in stock and I've done this with other components as well let's go back to the website and upload the file here and the thing to remember as well I know there's a lot of things to remember but one more thing to remember it's okay I can just continue with whatever I have uploaded is that there are people on the back end

that are going to look at these files and provide you with feedback and then of course ask questions my order is ready to go this doesn't mean that this order is actually going to go through the production Engineers will be looking at the G files the centroid file and the bomb to make sure that they can actually produce this PCB for example with a bomb file they will ensure that all the components needed to go on the board for the assembly are on hand and if they not on hand in the warehouse they'll have to

order them and if they're having trouble sourcing any of those components they'll get back to you to let you know so you can decide of whether you can Source those components yourself or maybe you need to find Alternatives but there's a lot of back and forth communication between you and the production Engineers throughout the process that that may take one or two weeks for the production to actually get started my production status is now complete and and the assembled boards have been sent but you can see here there's a dashboard that

shows where in the process your PCB is if there's any questions from the engineering team you'll receive an email with the questions uh there are going to be photographs as well if there's a problem with a particular component maybe the fit is not appropriate you'll get a photograph to indicate the problem and to find ways to fix it and you can see here some of the communications in stad changes uh over the last couple of weeks as this PCB was being manufactured I also want to show you here the engineering questions page on my next

PCB account just for you to have a better understanding of what happens once you submit your assembly job once the engineers on the next PCB production floor get a hold of your project files and they evaluate them most likely they will have questions so they will use this page here to Comm Comm unicate with you and you get email notifications as well to which you can reply or you can just go in here in this page have a look at each one of the messages and then use the the form provided to respond so of course my project is complete you can

see all of the messages that appear in this list so you can see how long the process took about 10 days from when the first message came to when it was completed and you can see the first message looks like this start down the bottom this is the whole history history here but you can see the first one was just to show that you know they've done a bit of work and they found something that needs to be fixed in this case here they attached an Excel sheet they identified three issues that needed my attentions the first one had to do with

two resistors and the connector and it says can't be soldered sometimes you just need to read in between the lines here so they have identified the components in the bomb that I provided there's a screenshot here and I like how they use screenshots to just pinpoint where the issue is so you don't have to wonderand and there's a suggestion that's very helpful added to the pick and place file after looking at this I realized that there's actually no J5 component so what happened here was that there used to be a J5 component

which are then deleted so there's no J5 that caused the confusion I just mentioned there a bit of History here that J5 was removed of the bom was submitted my mistake here that they picked up and the same thing applies for R17 and r 21 so things like that happen here's another example that they picked up J1 switch one and switch 2 the issue here is that they don't have a specific part number they couldn't find the appropriate part number from their bom that I've sent them so I was a little confused about this to be totally Frank

so I asked a follow-up question I understood that they needed me to provide a part number but I also wanted to double check if there was something in the footprint that I provided that would cause them difficulties with soldering the response that I got from this was that no the footprints and you the geometry of the Pats here was not a problem that just didn't have the part number so I provided a new bomb with the part numbers for those two components so the other thing was a bit of confusion as to the cathodes and the anodes of the

capacitors and the dodes because of the symbols used to denote cathodes so this case I simply confirmed that where you see a dot in a capacitor footprint or this bracket silk screen drawing that indicates the anode for the capacitors so dot is the anode not the cathode so there was a problem CAU early because they asked the right question and then for the diodes this symbol here the blue bracket graphic indicates the cathode so that was sorted out and it was fairly smooth sailing from then onward here's the next one asking me for confirmation

that the assembled PCB as I see it in these images is correct and then I had a very close look took my time to have a look around here so that was all pretty good the only thing that I did here was to ask for this particular header to be replaced just to put in something smaller like the one in j6 instead of this much ler one because this would make it harder for me to try out different devices on this I squ C header CU I don't have a plug like this they were happy to make the switch of this specific header and

then they came back to me just a little while later a couple of days later to let me know the song completed and just to confirm that there's no other changes i' like to the board but didn't have any additional requests so that was the end of this process after that at the beginning of the video I said I was planning to show you the final manuf factured PCB after receiving it from the manufacturer next PCB however due to shipping delays and just knowe that it's Chinese New Year at the moment plus we had a public H in Australia so all that

caused a delay with the delivery so having received the board yet but I am on a hectic schedule I just want to complete this video and not wait for the actual piece of be so there's that but once I do receive it I record a follow-up video where I'll unpack and show you what the real board looks like and I'm also be going to be doing a bit of testing I'll share my impressions of the final product walk you through the testing process I've have no idea if it will actually work I hope it will I've spent a lot of time testing

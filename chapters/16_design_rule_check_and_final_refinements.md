# Design Rule Check and Final Refinements



tests in here so you can add them and then and ignore them if you you want to the DRC shows no other issues that I need to deal with so that means that I can do the last minute improvements enhancements before going ahead with the design for manufacturing checks design for manufacturing checks are all those checks that I will be doing using the next PCB analytics tools that will give me some insights as to whether I've done something that would make manufacturing of the board harder these are not tests that tell me anything about whether the

board itself is functional or not but whether it actually can be built so before I do that there's a few little improvements that I will need to do things such as 90° angles this is something that would also be picked by the design for manufacturing Analytics tool but it is so obvious that I'm going to fix it now and other things such as uh removing any issues like this one here redundant segments of tracks and turns that are not really necessary and anything else it might pop up actually here might even try to reduce the length

of some of the longer tracks as I go so I'm going to start with this is quite obvious so make sure that I can select tracks and vs sometimes it's just easier to redraw a track  and I'll draw it with a much thicker track the same thing here okay there's a redundant that can go straight in like this for okay yeah I think that is good I'm going

# Adding Silkscreen and Final Touches

some room up here by removing the mounting hole so again pick up the text tool and the first one is going to be charging power okay and it's always a challenge to make this fit so let's make this 90° so that I can mount it in like this and it's done and I'll continue with the rest for example I'm going to go up here and add some text for the roll of these pens I use the same geometry for the text so this first one is going to be G and D I'm going I'm going to continue along the same way but to save us all bit of

time and especially you I'm not going to record this whole process and I'm going to come back in your time in just a few seconds and my time is going to be probably around 30 to 40 minutes when I would have completed the sil screen and that's it with the silk screen let's have a look I'm going to disable some of these layers take a better look at the sil screen layer so I've got all the borders between the different top circuits got a couple of logos as well there's always room for the tech Expos logo and the kyat in the back silk

screen layer can also have a look at the 3D View and there's our board actually looks quite nice like this which brings me to the next item in my list of items to do and that is to populate the missing components here for a full three 3D render of this board so let's get into it now in the current 3D model you can see that there's a few components that are missing the most important ones actually es32 is missing the SD card reader the USB module all these things are missing it's not going to take long to add them remember that when I set up

this project I already collected the 3D models for these important components and for other components such as the polyus here the LEDs some of the capacitors as well and even the microphone I'll be using components that come with kicker so I'll be looking K's own 3D model libraries let's start with doing this work the first thing to do is to set up all the components that don't have a 3D model whose model is in kad's own librar that will save me the trouble having to code to to different places back and forth and I'm going to leave

the 3D viewer open so that it gets updated as I configure each of the components with its 3D model let's begin with the microphone so double click on the microphone bring up its 3D model so for the 3D model of the microphone I'm going to go to kad's own libraries you can see I'm working in Kat 9 RC and in here there's 3D models and look for sensor of course when you do this for the first time you need to spend a bit of time to explore it's unlikely that you'll be able to find what you're looking for immediately

there's no search function so you really have to browse to find what you need so I've already done that of course so I know where to go sensor audio and I'm looking for pom there's two versions of the same model one is Step the other one is wrl I just go with step there's that and then I need to rotate it a little so I'm just going to lift it off first I'm going to add to the offset going to put it up for the time being and then do a rotate because I want to be able to see its pins as I'm rotating like actually other the side

yeah I need to go like this all right and then let's fix its pins okay let's go to the offset now and go down and then a little bit this way and that's it and finish up with this a offset done and there's the microphone cool let's continue I'll do the LEDs next because there's a few of them the first one is power for the power LED and for all the LEDs actually I'm going to use the same model for Simplicity there's no need to change here so here in this list there will be an LED SMD this one here and there's a few options you can see what

they look like you can have a look at them and play around I'm going to be pretty brief with this exploration and just go for the 1206 that seems to be the right size 1206 here there's the casted version but I'm just going to go with the simple one this one here looks good so okay that looks nice and for the others instead of having to browse I'm just going to copy the path to the the step file so just uh click and copy and go to the other LEDs you can search for Led in the footprints here so one by one add those LEDs in here remove

whatever may be in the 3D models list and then just click on the plus button to bring up the field and then copy paste and hit okay continue with the next one double click and repeat the same process and there's our LEDs I'll do the polyfuse next it's a large component right here remove whatever might be there and let's go through the list here so we're looking for the fuse 32 2 25 yep that's one it fits nicely hit okay another things you can do if you want to know what's remaining to be fixed click on this button here missing 3D models and

that will have a look to see what models are missing and you can see it picked up 61 missing models and it created a file so you can use that file to quickly in here you see missing 3D models I'm going to open it up with the text edor and there's the models that are missing so there's quite a lot of models missing but again don't let that scare you in this particular case what's happened is because I'm working with kick at 9 and kick at 8 at the same time I've got this path that doesn't exist in kickout 9 release candidate but somehow it found

its way in this file so I'm going to show you a way to fix this problem really quickly and easily because the thing is that once I fix this variable then the path is correct and kicker will be able to grab the missing 3D models all right so to fix that go back to the main kickout window and under preferences go to configure paths in here you see that I've got a few environmental variables but one that is not in here is the one that I actually need for this particular case now if you're working in kick up 9 the the

final version and you're not kick at 8 and kick at n like I am you're not going to have to worry about this but I'm showing you this because it's an opportunity to show you what you can do with the paths configuration window here to fix this very specific problem so here I'm going to add a new row add the variable that I want to add and I am going to click on this path copy it and paste it because I know that this actually exists this is what I'm picking up all of the component and the 3D models that I showed you so far so

essentially I'm going to have these two variables that are pointing to the same place and that is going to fix the issue with these missing 3D models all right so now let's do the check again only six missing perfect so we fixed most of them and the ones that I need to fix I'm just going to reopen this file have to do with legitimately missing 3D models not sure why the format didn't work out this time around but but uh let me just do this one more time just going to delete it going to delete these two and do the

check again okay six never mind it's fine so what's missing is C4 C3 C9 there's u4 there C7 C12 so these are the tandum capacitors first is C4 I'm just going to search for that so C4 double click on it and and this capacitor is in the building 3D models go for capacitor SMD capacitor tandum actually that's what I need go in here look for cpia the size is 3216 32168 Kemet this one right here I'll go for this step model done and you can remove the other one there so now I'm going to copy this hit okay and let's look for the

others so the next one is C3 just like what I did with the LED so I'm going to repeat the process here there you go should probably put a slightly larger capacitor there for the tunder but it's okay then it's C9 then it say s and that's it with the capacitors all right so all the capacitors are there C4 C7 and so on it's not that these are missing it's that they're not configured correctly that's why they're coming up there's other components that do have missing 3D models but they're not listed in this list because it just haven't

been configured and next one is u4 that is also misconfigured so let's look for that u4 this one here and for this I'm going to look in the built-in libraries I'm going for the package dfn and then in here I'm looking for qfn 16 it's one of those over here 1 EP 3x3 0.5 mm 1.8x 1.8 this one right here step yep okay done and it's properly aligned as well if I do another check you'll see that there's one missing u4 thought I just edit that didn't I oh yeah it's because I didn't delete the original so let's delete that

hit okay save and let's check again model is missing zero however if we have a look at the 3D viewer you'll see there's actually some models that don't have configuration so let's add them so these are all the models that I have collected at the beginning of the project and now I'm going to actually assign them to the footprints let's start with a connector down here this one the model is in the project directory so let's navigate to The Working project directory and in here is the libraries 3D models and then what I'm looking for is the B2 pH smm4

let oriented so rotate back and forth there's a bit of playing around with this until I get the right one that's the one next I'll do the USB port so this one is the SS  5240 okay perfect let's take a look at what the port looks like now all right yeah making progress let's continue with the two buttons the model is us lpt this one right here that's a models it won't fit exactly though so I'm going to need to fine tune it and I'm going to copy this because I've got another button so I'm just going to copy that

and assign it to the other button and set the same Transformations okay next up is the SD card so the model for that is the GSD 0 model in this directory GSD 0 yeah that's it and that happens to fit perfectly and I'm going to go up and sort out the model for the esp32 and the model for this is this one done let's take a pause and have a look yeah this is looking really nice not much more to go so the U6 Q 1 and VR1 left to do and the B me 280 up here You2 so the light sensor that is the tem t6000 you can see the pad configuration in the bottom now

you just need to make sure that these pads are correctly aligned this orientation is good so I just need to flip it on the xais by 90° and that's it yeah it's okay next of course the regulator lm117 3.3 so 90° flip done and I think it was youu to as well this is bme280 step we need to be bit mindful of pin one marked with this dot there against this dot so you can see where the dot is so I really need to flip it I think on the x-axis actually before the x-axis let's go back to where it was because I want to be able to see that dot let's go Z axis 90

Dees yep so that's aligned there so then X to make it close that's it and you can see that dot against that dot there let's have a look at what the motor looks like now have I missed anything oh yep I've missed U6 but I think everything else is now correct so let's uh finish with the flash memory the flash memory is model ID w25 Q32 okay and simply a 90° on the x-axis would do all right so let's have a look at the final result of all this work there's the board it looks amazing in my opinion this gives you a really good

idea of where things are what the final result is going to look like if the user interface is reasonable and workable even if the test points are where they should be there is room to make changes here and even at this point those changes are not necessarily painful you will be able to make oh you just noticed one more the amplifier here one more component is missing let's do that the amplifier from memory let's see the is the max 4466 exk flip that on the X AIS yep and that's it have a look one last time and

there's the amplifier and I think yeah now everything is where it's supposed to be the PCB is now ready to export from Kut and import into your manufacturer of choice in my case I'm going to go ahead with the order and the assembly through next PCB let's have a look at what that looks like on the next PCB website let's go back to the homepage just to make this easy to follow as possible when you go to the next PCB website you've got a couple of options you see under PCB service the first one is to get a quote

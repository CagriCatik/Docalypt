# Component Placement and Design Challenges

an SD card this is remember an iot development board so you may want to use an SD card to do things such as data logging then I've got a flash memory also that can be used to store data from the various environmental measurements up here I've got the BME 280 environment sensor you can use the sensor to capture temperature humidity and atmospheric pressure right here is an ambient light sensor so you can capture information about the light intensity up here there's a microphone for capturing sound intensity right here I've got a USBC

connector we'll be using this USBC connector for power and for data there's a couple of buttons on the right side enable and boot just to operate with the esp32 I've got integrated circuits here for the serial Communications so this chip here helps to manage the USB and the serial Communications of the board in this block here I've Got The Power regulator circuitry down here I've got the battery management circuitry this a battery connector for a lipo battery plus its integrated circuit for managing charging of the battery and then finally

I've got a couple of headers here you can connect those headers to things such as an O LED display or external components so this is a four layer PCB again kind of have a look inside see what's going on in the 3D representation so four layer PCB I'm going to talk more about the details of the design of the PCB in the next segment of this video will cover everything from the design guidelines and the parts selection to creating the schematic routing the PCB and preparing it for manufacturing and I'll also show you how to order your

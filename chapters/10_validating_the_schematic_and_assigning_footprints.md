# Validating the Schematic and Assigning Footprints

one right here assign Footprints so let's have a look at what we have so okay just say okay to these Legacy entries notifications so some components already have associations you can see here that F1 has an association it's the fuse the connector J1 also has an association and so on but many other components like these capacitors for example don't have an association so let's go ahead and add those now for Passive components like the capacitors and there's a bunch of resistors down here as well I am standardizing those

components for the 0805 SMD versions of these resistors there's many different sizes of course and I can go for through hole components and I can go for tiny SMD components as well for this particular design where I am trying to balance the size and the cost I'm going to go for a more general purpose size such as the 0805 I could go much smaller than that but that would increase the assembly and Manufacturing cost I'm going to start with the first one and actually what you can do in ki it you can even select all

of them actually I'll do that because all of those are the same I think there are a couple of footprints here that I'll be using tandum capacitors such as this one right here the C3 a second yeah C3 here and C4 those are going to be Tander capacitors so I'm going to leave this aside for this multi select I'm going to go for all the small ones I'm selecting them all using the shift key and my mouse and then using the command key or control in Windows I will unselect all those capacitors that I will be assigning to tunder room

components so the 10 use also the 4.7 use I'll exclude those to and I'm just looking at my notes now believe yeah everything else is okay to go with a 0805 2012 metric footprint all right so having those selected then I'm going to go to the footprint libraries on the left side and look for capacitor SMD and on the other side you can see my filters here as well are such that when I click on a library on the left side only the components that are part of that Library appear on the right side if I un select this filter can see that the options

available uh multiply because everything now is available so play around with those filters so that you can reduce the number of items that are showing in the right side just to make it easier to find what you're looking for just a little Annoying that it's just not very easy to see when a filter is selected there is a faint blue border around it to indicate that it is selected okay so now I'm looking for all 805 you can see there's much smaller ones like o201 and so on so I've selected the capacitors that I want to apply the association and

I've selected the footprint that I want to associate these capacitors with the 0805 2012 metric and I'm just going to double click and you can see that they've been assigned you can also not going to do it now because uh my release cited one uh version of my kick at 9 instance crashes when I do that but if you want to see exactly what you're assigning to you can select the footprint and then click on this button right here to view the selected footprint and that will actually bring it up in a small editor window let's now

do a multi select for the tandum capacitors and uh for this I'm going to go into capacitor tandum SMD I'm going to search using the filter here because I've have installed a specific capacitor footprint that I found and that's the T4 91a and I believe that the capacitor is somewhere down here right in here so this is the footprints that I imported and you can see in my library's Footprints the footprint that I've just selected is this one right here double click on that and assign it and I am done with the capacitors

next let's do the resistors resistors things are a little bit easier because I'm going to be using the same footprint for all of them so do a multi select across all of the resistors and then go to resistors SMD remove that from the filter and I'm looking for 0805 again metric this one double click and I've done the multi- assign okay let's see what else remains to be assigned I've got the two connectors here the four and the five pin connector for the four pin connector I will go into kets connector pin header Library

just going to go for the standard 2.54 mm pitch so that it works with standard connectors and this is going to be a just going to search in here just to use the filter 1X 04 so that narrows down the options that I have have and I can choose any of those but I'm going to go for the regular 1 by 04 2. 2.

54 mm vertical double click done and I'll do the same for the 05 so the one with the 5 pin and I'll go for vertical as well right done with the connectors next up we've got the test points here the test points are just pads essentially so I'm going to go to test point library right here remove the text from the filter and let's see lots of options here I am going to go for a reasonable option which is say a 1 mm pad just going to search for 1.

0 mm and all of those have got a 1.0 mm in the name just going to go for this one all of those are going to have the same pads so double click on that single pad and I'm done and I think that that is it with the associations it looks like all of the symbols have Associated Footprints I'm just going to do a visual inspection just to make sure that I have all of the footprints that I want if I make a mistake of course I can always come back if I see in the actual La out editor that I don't like a particular Associated footprint I can always change

it the process is very quick and easy in in modern versions of Kad it's not hassle like it used to be in earlier versions it all looks good so I'm going to click down here on Save schematic and continue and click okay and we're done you can see down here that I've got a Search tool enabled which you can show or hide from The View panels menu right there and you can see the associations here as well and you can click around the schematic head double pan to the appropriate location to show you the symbol that you've just select and let's

continue with the validation and error checking and to do that we'll use the ERC which you can invoke by clicking this button right up here on the toolbar electrical rules check you can see down here that we've got errors warnings and exclusions there's a few ignored uh Che tests that you can see right here and these are the defaults I haven't changed anything let's see what comes up I'm going to run the ERC you can see I've got four errors and a few warnings here and there's a few ignored tests as well I'm going to ignore the

warnings for now and have a look at the errors just unchecked warnings just to clean up my list of violations and errors you can see the effect I want to deal with those first and then I'll see if there's anything that actually need to do with the warnings going to click on the first one and see what comes up right so you can see as I'm clicking on on items in the list the schematic editor pans across to the location of the issue so the first thing has to do with uh J1 it says pin A4 is a power pin that is not driven by any output power

pins Okay click on the component double click on it actually and go to pin functions you can see that pin A4 this pin right here is marked as power input I've connected it to the vbus net but that doesn't really tell Kat anything about what kind of net that is and because Kad expects due to the electrical type of this particular pin that this is going to be a Power Pin and need somehow to tell Kat that I've taken care of that situation and vbus is actually a net that conveys power I did it in one of the other that's I'm just

going to show you here right here VSS I had the same issue and I actually preempted this error message from Kad by including the power flag but I forgot to do it in this instance here so what I'm going to do is to Simply duplicate the power flag symbol command D or control D and I am going to connect it say around here place it there and then connect it to the vbus net and rerun the ERC and that should yep take care of that so three errors remaining next one that's a big one actually I totally forgot to wire pin three in U1 that goes the

ground so I'm going to reposition this label I'm just going to place it here right on the junction all right and then for sale this needs to be grounded so I'm just going to copy the ground symbol place it here and wire pin three to ground r thec one error remaining and you can probably figure out how I'm going to fix this as well it's the same situation as the first error that I fixed earlier so I'm just going to again duplicate power flag symbol and flip it and I'm just going to place it here aroundc okay good no more

violations let's have a quick look at the warnings so there's a bunch of issues with libraries what K is complaining is that this J2 component for example is using a footprint library with this name that is not included in the current configuration the error message just going to put the window up there so we can see it uh is for footprint B2B pH Etc this one right here the jst connector so that's in here so this library that Kik is complaining about is inside this file but it's still complaining so I know that it's working

so I'm just going to ignore it for now and see what happens once I get to the layout editor okay the next one says that the copy of the symbol that I'm using here doesn't match the original Library I don't remember if I've done any changes to it but you can see this is the reference for the symbol have a look inside that symbol using the editor and what I suspect may have happened is that I opened at some point a symbol editor and I did something like maybe moved one of those labels around and then saved it and that caused that

discrepancy between the symbol that is now present in the project versus the one in the library and that's why it's complain that there's no match anymore which is fine for me I I don't really care too much about that particular issue so I'm going to ignore it then there's another carrying configuration doesn't include the footprint Library just like the first one next got this issue here of pins of type by B directional and power output are connected it says that pin 8 and pin one are connected so if you look at this

ground symbol it's got one pin which is of type power and then dot one andt two can double click you can see that this is pin n and 8 Pin 9 and 8 of type B directional and there's a mismatch that Kik had to warn me about but looking at it after inspecting those pins and how I've connected them I'm happy that there's no issue here so again I am going going to ignore this warning same thing happens here and I'm not going to go through all of them because you can see that the same type of warnings are repeated across the entire list so at this point

I can either just ignore click on close and continue with the layout editor or it can also do things such as right click on one of those warnings and Market is excluded you can exclude with comments each time I exclude this violation and choose this command it affects only the a single violation that I've highlighted but if I want to exclude all of the violations of the same type then I can right click and then choose ignore all and that will take care of all of them again I'm not going to do that if you want to

reinstate the warnings that you've excluded just go into the exclusion so show them and then you can just remove the exclusion from this violation like this and that will bring it back okay let's close it window and I'm going to save my project and we are now ready to continue with the layout in the layout editor let's continue with the layout editor there's a couple of ways to get there we can go via the project window or we can just click on the same button in the tool in the schematic editor all right here's the totally

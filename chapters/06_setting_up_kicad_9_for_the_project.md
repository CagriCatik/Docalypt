# Setting Up KiCad 9 for the Project

for the requirements of this particular video recording you can run these two versions or as many versions as you like really in parallel no problem at all as to how you organize your kick it instances all right so as we've learned already in the previous few segments of this video I've already taken a bit of time through research and uh preparation for this project and worked out my bill of materials and in a realistic situation where you're just starting fresh with a new project this bom is probably not going to be the final one

you'll be working through the details as you're working through the project but in my case uh since I've already rehearsed this video and of pretty much completed the entire process a couple of times prior to actually recording this video I have a pretty good idea of the components that are going to be in it and so I've got the benefit of the build of material being pretty much finalized just keep in mind in real life if you were working on this project for the very first time just like I did when I went through it for the very first time

I only had a partial set of components here I had the major components such as of course the integrated circuits and the microcontroller unit the esp32 had a good idea of the rest of the components such as the the diodes and the buttons and then I went with more generic options for things such as the resistors and the capacitors in previous segments of the video I explained that as part of my preparation I went ahead used various online resources mostly snapa but a few other resources that are also available aailable in order to find

download and make available especially the footprints and the symbols but also the data sheets I've spent a lot of time reading through data sheets before I even started drawing anything in kiat and that's Again part of your preparation I estimate that when I add all the time that I put in to prepare for the project the total amount of time spent would be about five to six good working hours to collect all of these files okay so let's get started with Kad I've already started the application and I'm going to go into a new project and

I'm going to save this new project in this directory that I've already started and because the directory already exists I'm just going to uncheck this option to create yet a new folder so I just want Kat to store all of its files in the directory that I've just selected so I give it a name Kat 9 esp32 demo project and save yeah the selected folder is not empty I'm fully aware that there's content in this directory and yes I want to continue so there the new files just created as part of this new project the

next thing I want to do is to do some basic setup I'll do that under Key Cat settings there a few things I want to check things such as the high quality analizing just makes everything look better in the schematic and the drawings going to jump into the schematic editor and have a look at a few things here such as the display options I tend to go with the defaults there now and the grids there's a couple of things I want to double check as well I've got the 150 25 and 10 ms which is good and then for the fast switching I've got 50 Ms and 25

Ms for that and all the grid overrides as well look good all right so that's okay again all this is really personal preference tends to work better for me and I'm going to go to the editing options and have a look inside here all this looks okay annotation options also look good just going to skip the rest I'm just going to accept the defaults for everything else and go into the PCB editor and have a look around here all this again looks fine as it is and just notice I'm going for four window crosshairs makes it easier to align

things together when I'm using full window crosshairs and the same thing happens with the schematic editor then for the grids these are the grids that I've already selected and created your list of grids is probably going to be much smaller if your Ki installation is new uh but in my case I've Ed a few additional grids and these are my grid overrides origin access and editing options defaults work fine click okay next up have a look at the plugins I'm just going to go into the plugins and content manager by the button here just

want to show you the plugins that I've got installed so in this project I'm only going to be using a couple of these plug I have a new Fresh installation of kard I tend to install these plugins which I tend to use from time to time so there's interactive HTML bomb PCB action tools round tracks works really nice free routing and the HQ dfm which I'll be using at the very end of this project to test my board before submitting it for manufacturing and I've got a few other plugins here as well out of this entire

list I recommend that you install at the very least the free routing plug-in and the HQ dfm so next up let's go into preferences and install the symbol and the footprint libraries remember that I've already collected those libraries here and stored inside the same project directory so I'll start with the footprints notice that I've got an option here to import those libraries globally so for all future projects or for the project specifically and I like to have a better control of the libraries for each project then I tend

to go for the Project Specific libraries option unless there is a library that I'm installing that I know I'll be using across multiple projects in this case most of the components I'll be using will be specific to this project so I'm opting for the Project Specific libraries here so then I'm going to use this option here to select a kick at folder with kick at mod files so click on this button then I'm already in the project folder go into libraries select Footprints just set the folder level and click on open and that's it just going

to change the name here I'm going to call that esp32 project libraries this nickname will make it easier for me to recognize that I'm selecting a footprint from inside this particular project Footprints library and click okay let's do the same for the symbols so I for the same reason I'm going to go for the Project Specific libraries click on the folder button and then go into symbols unfortunately I can't select all of the library files in this directory I have to select them either one by one and click on open or do a multi select

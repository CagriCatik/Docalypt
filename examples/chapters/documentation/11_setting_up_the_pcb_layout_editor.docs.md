# PCB Design Overview for a Compact 2‑Layer Board

## Design Objectives and Constraints

The board is intended to house a microcontroller unit (MCU) with an integrated PCB antenna, high‑speed memory interfaces, and a set of user‑interface components (SD card, USB port, buttons, charging port, LEDs, and sensors). The primary

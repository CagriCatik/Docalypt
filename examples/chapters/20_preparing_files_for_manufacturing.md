# Preparing Files for Manufacturing



crosschecking and verifying the design just to make sure that I haven't missed anything big so I'm pretty confident that it will work but of course testing is required I do have high confidence that it will work but that remains to be be seen to make sure you don't miss that upcoming video please do subscribe to the tech expression Channel right now if you haven't done so already to quickly recap this very long video we covered everything here from creating the schematic to managing libraries to designing the PCB layout routing

performing the various design checks along the way I shared my experiences with Kat 9 I've been using for this video video K 9 release candidate 1 the beginning and a little bit later RC 2 when it came out and I was able to take advantage of the numerous improvements in kiat 9 along the way you saw firsthand what it is like to use kiat 9 to build a PCB like this one a four layer realistic iot PCB by the time that you watch this kick at 9.

0 will be out and as a community I believe that we'll have gained an even better open-source PCB design tool so thank you for watching this unusually long video I truly appreciate your time and interest in this project and I hope that this video has been helpful in demonstrating the process from setting up the schematic and selecting components to laying out the PB and preparing it for manufacturing if you found this content valuable please consider subscribing to the channel and to stay updated on future videos including as I said the
